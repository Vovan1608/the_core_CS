Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:
N is divisible by divisor.
N is less than or equal to bound.
N is greater than 0.
It is guaranteed that such a number exists.
Example
For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be
maxMultiple(divisor, bound) = 9.
The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.
